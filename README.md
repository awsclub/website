# AWS Cloud Club · CCT College Dublin

This repository contains the source code for the official website of the **AWS Cloud Club at CCT College Dublin**.  
It is a simple, modern, and responsive site intended to give the Club a public presence while keeping the implementation lightweight, fully debuggable, and transparent.

---

## Purpose

The site was built with three priorities in mind:

1. **Visibility** – Provide a clear identity for the Cloud Club that can be shared with students, staff, and external partners.  
2. **Accessibility** – Fully open source, mobile-friendly, and simple enough to be extended by any student with basic web development knowledge.  
3. **Professionalism** – Serve as a showcase of how to deliver a minimal but production-ready project, in line with academic and industry expectations.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript** – No heavy frameworks, so everything is transparent and easy to debug.  
- **Responsive Design** – Sidebar on desktop, hamburger toggle on mobile.  
- **Background Video** – Fixed looping `.webm` / `.mov` asset with a subtle overlay for readability.  
- **Animations** – Sections fade in on scroll using the Intersection Observer API.  
- **Branding** – AWS dark slate + AWS orange for consistency with Cloud Club guidelines.
